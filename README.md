# Name Generator
Generate random person names.

This uses the [naming language generator](https://github.com/mewo2/naming-language) from [mewo2](https://github.com/mewo2) for the first names.

The middle initial is a random English letter.

The last name is a random English noun from Desi Quintans' "[The Great Noun List](http://www.desiquintans.com/nounlist)" with random affixes (none, prefix, suffix, or both) from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_family_name_affixes).

## How to use

* Clicking "New random name" will generate a new random name and add it to the list.
* Use the small copy button next to each name to copy individual names.
* The "Copy all" button will copy the the whole list of names, newline-separated. 
* Clicking the "Clear all" button or closing the page will clear the list.
